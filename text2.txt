There are many important holidays in a calendar year, but my favourite one is March 8th. Everybody knows that it’s an international Women’s Day, but for me it’s a special day. First of all, it’s the beginning of spring, which is my favourite season. The weather is almost always fine on this day. Secondly, people seem to become happier on this day.
